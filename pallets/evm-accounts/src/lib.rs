//! # EVM accounts pallet
//!
//! ## Terminology
//!
//! * **Truncated address:** * A substrate address created from an EVM address by prefixing it with
//!   "ETH\0" and appending with eight 0 bytes.
//! * **Full Substrate address:** * Original 32 bytes long native address (not a truncated address).
//! * **EVM address:** * First 20 bytes of a Substrate address.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The pallet allows users to bind their Substrate account to the EVM address and to grant a
//! permission to deploy smart contracts. The purpose of this pallet is to make interaction with the
//! EVM easier. Binding an address is not necessary for interacting with the EVM.
//!
//! ### Binding
//! Without binding, we are unable to get the original Substrate address from the EVM address inside
//! of the EVM. Inside of the EVM, we have access only to the EVM address (first 20 bytes of a
//! Substrate account). In this case we create and use a truncated version of the original Substrate
//! address that called the EVM. The original and truncated address are two different Substrate
//! addresses.
//!
//! With binding, we store the last 12 bytes of the Substrate address. Then we can get the original
//! Substrate address by concatenating these 12 bytes stored in the storage to the EVM address.
//!
//! ### Smart contract deployment
//! This pallet also allows granting a permission to deploy smart contracts.
//! `ControllerOrigin` can add this permission to EVM addresses.
//! The list of whitelisted accounts is stored in the storage of this pallet.
//!
//! ### Dispatchable Functions
//!
//! * `bind_evm_address` - Binds a Substrate address to EVM address.
//! * `add_contract_deployer` - Adds a permission to deploy smart contracts.
//! * `remove_contract_deployer` - Removes a permission of whitelisted address to deploy smart
//!   contracts.
//! * `renounce_contract_deployer` - Renounce caller's permission to deploy smart contracts.
